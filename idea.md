<!-- Components:  -->
    <!-- One for the shopping items{image,name,quantity,description} -->

<!-- Navbar
    make a navbar that shows up on every page that has links to the shopping page and the home page -->

Pages:
    Home page that displays the name of the shop, i think i should do a classic website where they have the name 
        then the link to the shopping place, street address and all the other links to contact or whatever
    Shopping page that shows all the items in a flex/grid order; and has an add to cart item

    Maybe make a page that shows items in a cart? idk how id do this without a storage tho, maybe use localStorage?


Get shop items from FakeStore API?

TODO:
    find how to make the items button and price line up with eachother, rn they are all lopsided
