    find how to make the items button and price line up with eachother, rn they are all lopsided

store cart items in local storage and add delete button


UPDATES:

    so i got carts to be a toggle button, but now its really a pain in the ass to use, i want to make its own split page like most websites do i think?
        HOMEWORK: Go look at other websites and see how their carts work(only if its the kind of cart i want)
            - And reRead the section on nested routes in odin project!
    -----
        Maybe make it so that it conditionally renders a page based on if cart was clicked and that page loads on the right side? i might be getting the wrong idea but i think the route i need to go down is nested routes?
